# Everything Cursor

**Production-ready Cursor AI configurations — rules, skills, agents, commands, hooks, and MCP configs.**

A complete, reusable configuration template that brings professional software engineering practices into AI-assisted development with Cursor IDE.

Based on [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) — adapted, enhanced, and optimized for Cursor.

## Architecture

```
.cursor/
├── rules/         8 rules    Enforced constraints (security, style, testing, git, auto-routing)
├── agents/       10 agents   Specialized AI roles with CoT reasoning + orchestrator
├── skills/        5 skills   Deep domain knowledge injection
├── commands/      8 commands Lightweight slash command triggers
├── hooks/         4 checks   Quality gate definitions
├── mcp-configs/   2 presets  External tool integration
└── mcp.json                  Default MCP configuration
```

### Design Principles

1. **Layered Context Loading** — Only 4 rules are always-on. Testing, performance, and patterns rules activate based on file globs to save tokens.
2. **Separation of Concerns** — Agents = deep role-play with reasoning. Commands = lightweight trigger descriptions. Skills = domain knowledge. Rules = enforced constraints.
3. **Prompt Engineering Quality** — All agents include: identity, thinking process, constraints, output format, and exit conditions.
4. **Production Realism** — Hooks are documented with actual integration paths (husky + lint-staged), not just conceptual definitions.

## Quick Start

### One-Click Full Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jy315189/everything-cursor.git
cd everything-cursor

# Windows PowerShell — interactive menu
.\init.ps1

# macOS/Linux — interactive menu
chmod +x init.sh && ./init.sh
```

The script will show an interactive menu:

```
[1] Global Install    — Rules + Skills for all projects
[2] Project Init      — Agents + Commands for this project
[3] Full Setup        — Both global + project
[4] Check Status      — See what's installed
```

### Command-Line Flags (non-interactive)

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\init.ps1 -Global              # Rules + Skills globally
.\init.ps1 -Project             # Agents + Commands for current project
.\init.ps1 -All                 # Full setup (global + project)
.\init.ps1 -All -Force          # Full setup, overwrite existing
.\init.ps1 -Status              # Check installation status

# macOS/Linux
./init.sh --global
./init.sh --project
./init.sh --all
./init.sh --all --force
./init.sh --status
```

### Initialize a New Project (quick command)

After global install, run this in any new project to enable agents:

```powershell
# Windows — from your new project root
& "D:\projectse\everything-cursor\init.ps1" -Project
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux — from your new project root
/path/to/everything-cursor/init.sh --project
```

> **Why per-project?** Cursor only reads Agents and Commands from the project's `.cursor/` directory, not from the global `~/.cursor/`. Rules and Skills work globally.

### What Goes Where

| Module | Install Location | Why |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| Rules | **Global** `~/.cursor/rules/` | Applies to all projects automatically |
| Skills | **Global** `~/.cursor/skills/` | Available in all projects via @skills/ |
| Agents | **Per-project** `.cursor/agents/` | Cursor only reads agents from project directory |
| Commands | **Per-project** `.cursor/commands/` | Cursor only reads commands from project directory |
| Hooks | **Per-project** `.cursor/hooks/` | Project-specific quality gates |
| MCP | **Per-project** `.cursor/mcp.json` | Project-specific tool integrations |

## Module Reference

### Rules (`.cursor/rules/`)

Enforced constraints the AI must follow. Uses Cursor's `.mdc` format with YAML frontmatter.

| Rule | Loading Strategy | Purpose |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| `security.mdc` | **Always on** | No secrets, input validation, injection prevention |
| `coding-style.mdc` | **Always on** | Immutability, file limits, naming, no `any` |
| `git-workflow.mdc` | **Always on** | Conventional commits, PR process |
| `workflow.mdc` | **Always on** | Standard development process (plan → TDD → review → PR) |
| `auto-routing.mdc` | **Always on** | Automatic task detection — routes user requests to the correct agent workflow |
| `testing.mdc` | **Glob: test files** | TDD workflow, coverage targets — only loads for `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*` |
| `performance.mdc` | **Glob: perf-sensitive** | Optimization rules — only loads for cache/query/loader files |
| `patterns.mdc` | **Glob: services/api** | Design patterns — only loads for service/API/repository files |

> **Token savings**: By glob-targeting 3 of 8 rules, context overhead is reduced by ~40% for non-test, non-API work.

### Agents (`.cursor/agents/`)

Specialized AI roles with structured prompt engineering: identity, thinking process (Chain-of-Thought), constraints, strict output format, and exit conditions.

| Agent | Role | Key Feature |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `orchestrator` | **AI Project Manager** | **Auto-delegates to specialized agents based on task type. Coordinates multi-phase workflows.** |
| `planner` | Task decomposition & planning | Risk assessment, dependency mapping |
| `architect` | System design decisions | Multi-option comparison with trade-offs |
| `tdd-guide` | TDD cycle coaching | Step-by-step RED → GREEN → REFACTOR |
| `code-reviewer` | Code quality review | Severity-rated findings with fixes |
| `security-reviewer` | Vulnerability analysis | OWASP-based, CVSS severity ratings |
| `build-error-resolver` | Build error diagnosis | Systematic diagnosis, not guessing |
| `e2e-runner` | Playwright E2E tests | Anti-flakiness patterns built in |
| `refactor-cleaner` | Dead code removal | Safety verification before removal |
| `doc-updater` | Documentation sync | Keeps docs in sync with code changes |

#### Orchestrator — Automatic Workflow Coordination

The `orchestrator` agent acts as an AI project manager. It analyzes your request, selects the right agents, and executes multi-phase workflows automatically:

| Your Request | Orchestrator Executes |
|-------------|----------------------|
| "Add a payment feature" | Planner → Architect → TDD Guide → Code Reviewer → Doc Updater |
| "Fix this bug" | TDD (reproduce) → Fix → Code Reviewer |
| "Build failed with TS2339" | Build Error Resolver → Fix → Verify |
| "Check security of /api/" | Security Reviewer → Remediate → Code Reviewer |
| "Clean up dead code" | Refactor Cleaner → Code Reviewer |

**Usage**: `@orchestrator` for complex multi-step tasks. For simple tasks, the `auto-routing` rule handles it automatically — just talk naturally.

### Skills (`.cursor/skills/`)

Deep domain knowledge that goes beyond what AI models know by default. Each skill provides decision frameworks, code patterns, and anti-patterns for a specific domain.

| Skill | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `backend-patterns` | Layered architecture, API design, caching strategy, error hierarchy, RBAC, event-driven patterns |
| `coding-standards` | Immutability enforcement, naming conventions, TypeScript strictness, Result type, size limits |
| `frontend-patterns` | Server/Client component decisions, state management tree, TanStack Query, virtualization, forms |
| `security-review` | OWASP Top 10 checklist, input validation layers, password/JWT security, rate limiting, security headers |
| `tdd-workflow` | Full TDD cycle with examples, testing pyramid, mocking patterns, coverage strategy, anti-patterns |

### Commands (`.cursor/commands/`)

Lightweight slash commands that describe when to use each workflow and delegate to the appropriate agent.

| Command | Trigger | Delegates To |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/tdd` | Implement a feature with TDD | `@agents/tdd-guide` |
| `/plan` | Create implementation plan | `@agents/planner` |
| `/code-review` | Review code quality | `@agents/code-reviewer` |
| `/security-audit` | Security vulnerability scan | `@agents/security-reviewer` |
| `/build-fix` | Fix build errors | `@agents/build-error-resolver` |
| `/e2e` | Generate E2E tests | `@agents/e2e-runner` |
| `/refactor-clean` | Remove dead code | `@agents/refactor-cleaner` |
| `/doc-sync` | Update documentation | `@agents/doc-updater` |

### Hooks (`.cursor/hooks/`)

Quality check definitions with real integration path via husky + lint-staged.

| Check | Severity | Detects |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `no-console-log` | Warning | `console.log` in source files |
| `no-hardcoded-secrets` | Error | API keys, passwords, tokens in code |
| `no-ts-ignore` | Error | `@ts-ignore` that hides type errors |
| `no-any-type` | Warning | Explicit `any` type annotations |

> See `hooks/README.md` for husky + lint-staged setup instructions.

### MCP Configs (`.cursor/mcp-configs/`)

| Preset | Servers | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `minimal.json` | GitHub, Context7 | Lightweight setup |
| `full-stack.json` | GitHub, Memory, Context7, Supabase, Vercel, Playwright, Filesystem | Full-stack development |

> **Tip**: Keep ≤10 MCP servers enabled. Too many reduces your context window.

## Customization

These configurations are starting points. Customize for your project:

| What to Change | Where | Example |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| Coverage threshold | `rules/testing.mdc` | Change `≥ 80%` to your target |
| File size limit | `rules/coding-style.mdc` | Change `≤ 800 lines` |
| Rule loading | Any `.mdc` frontmatter | Change `alwaysApply` / `globs` |
| Add commit types | `rules/git-workflow.mdc` | Add `perf:`, `i18n:` |
| MCP servers | `mcp.json` | Enable/disable servers |
