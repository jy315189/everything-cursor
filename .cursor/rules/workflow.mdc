# Development Workflow

## Standard Process

| Task Type | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|
| New feature | Plan → Define types → TDD → Self-review → PR |
| Bug fix | Reproduce with test → Fix → Verify → Regression test → PR |
| Refactor | Ensure tests pass → Incremental changes → Test after each → PR |
| API endpoint | Types → Integration tests → Handler → Validation → Docs → PR |
| UI component | Props interface → Unit tests → Implement → Accessibility check → PR |

## Before Writing Code

1. **Clarify** — What exactly needs to be built? What are the acceptance criteria?
2. **Break down** — Split into tasks completable in 1-4 hours
3. **Assess risk** — Security implications? Performance concerns? Breaking changes?

## Self-Review Checklist (before every PR)

```
Security:    □ No secrets  □ Input validated  □ No injection vectors
Quality:     □ Functions ≤50 lines  □ Files ≤800 lines  □ Errors handled
Testing:     □ Tests included  □ Edge cases covered  □ Coverage ≥80%
Style:       □ Immutable patterns  □ No any  □ No console.log
Docs:        □ JSDoc updated  □ README updated if needed  □ CHANGELOG entry
```
