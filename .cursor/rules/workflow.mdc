# Development Workflow

## Feature Implementation

### Phase 1: Planning

Before writing code:

1. **Clarify Requirements**
   - What needs to be built?
   - What are the acceptance criteria?
   - What are the edge cases?

2. **Break Down Tasks**
   - Create specific, actionable steps
   - Identify dependencies
   - Estimate complexity (High/Medium/Low)

3. **Assess Risks**
   - Technical challenges
   - Integration points
   - Performance concerns
   - Security considerations

### Phase 2: Test-Driven Development

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
```

1. **Define Interfaces** - Types and contracts first
2. **Write Failing Tests** - Tests should fail initially
3. **Implement Minimal Code** - Just enough to pass
4. **Verify Tests Pass** - Run test suite
5. **Refactor** - Improve code quality
6. **Check Coverage** - Ensure 80%+ coverage

### Phase 3: Code Review

Self-review before PR:

**Security:**
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities

**Quality:**
- [ ] Functions < 50 lines
- [ ] Files < 800 lines
- [ ] Error handling present

**Best Practices:**
- [ ] Immutable patterns
- [ ] Tests included
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Phase 4: Commit & Deploy

- Follow conventional commits
- Create comprehensive PR description
- Request review
- Address feedback
- Merge when approved

## Task-Specific Workflows

### Bug Fixes
1. Write test that reproduces the bug
2. Verify test fails
3. Implement fix
4. Verify test passes
5. Add regression tests

### Refactoring
1. Ensure existing tests pass
2. Make incremental changes
3. Run tests after each change
4. Commit frequently

### New API Endpoint
1. Define request/response types
2. Write integration tests
3. Implement handler
4. Add validation
5. Document in OpenAPI/Swagger

### New Component
1. Define props interface
2. Write unit tests
3. Implement component
4. Add Storybook story
5. Document usage
