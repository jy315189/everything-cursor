# /plan - Implementation Planning

Create a detailed implementation plan for a feature or task.

## Usage

```
/plan [feature or task description]
```

## Process

### Step 1: Requirement Analysis

I will analyze and clarify:
- What exactly needs to be built?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- What are the edge cases?
- What are the constraints?

### Step 2: Task Breakdown

Break down into specific, actionable tasks:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Task 1.1 - Complexity: Low
- [ ] Task 1.2 - Complexity: Medium

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Task 2.1 - Complexity: High
  - Depends on: Task 1.1, 1.2

### Phase 3: Testing & Integration
- [ ] Task 3.1 - Write tests
- [ ] Task 3.2 - Integration
```

### Step 3: Risk Assessment

Identify potential risks and mitigations:
- Technical challenges
- Integration points
- Performance concerns
- Security considerations

### Step 4: Success Criteria

Define clear success criteria for each task.

## Example

```
/plan Add user authentication with OAuth2
```

Output:
1. Requirements analysis
2. Task list with dependencies
3. Risk assessment
4. Implementation order recommendation
